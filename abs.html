<p> The connectivity and accessibility of social media platforms around the world allow people to
express their ideas and share experiences easily. However, the anonymity and flexibility afforded
by the internet have made it easy for users to communicate aggressively. In the last five years,
the ever-growing usage of social media in Ethiopia has fueled the countryâ€˜s problem with
peaceful coexistence.
Illegitimate social media usage has played a significant role in widening the gap between people.
As a result, the government has increasingly relied on the temporary closure of social media
sites, nationwide internet shutdowns, and filtering websites to suppress polarizing voices and the
misuse of social media as the tension among many ethnic groups becomes more visible.
Online spaces are often exploited and misused to spread content that can be degrading, abusive,
or otherwise harmful to people. Hateful speech has become a major problem for every kind of
online platform where user-generated content appears, from the comment sections of news
articles and websites to real-time chat sessions within different forms such as text, image, audio,
text with image, and image with audio. A meme is a form of media that consists of graphics and
text overlapped so that together they present concepts, and they become dubious if one of them is
absent. Many memes are uploaded and spread every day on social media platforms as jokes,
sarcasm, and motivation. Therefore, we need to censor memes automatically to curb
misinformation and hateful content on social media.
Using cutting-edge deep learning techniques, we suggest solutions to these and other issues by
classifying memes as hateful or non-hateful using a combination of visual and linguistic data.
For this assignment, we first collected meme data from various sources. Then, for training,
testing, and evaluation, we employ this dataset.</p>
